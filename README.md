# Your First (Several) Asynchronous Requests

## Review (Synchronous vs. Asynchronous)
You are already a pro at making HTTP requests from your Browser to your Server. For instance, when you click a link, submit a form, or enter a new address into your browser bar, you are firing off an HTTP request. You've learned to make your server send back different types of data in text, HTML, JSON, and other formats, and how to redirect the browser to another location.

### Synchronous
These normal requests freeze the browser's interface, so the user must wait for them to finish before taking any new action. Usually the browser will display an entirely new HTML page to the screen. Since everything must wait for these requests, we call them "Synchronous". That means "no two things can happen at the same time."

### Asynchronous
As we saw during today's lecture, your browser can also make requests in the background. These requests do not block or freeze the user's interface, and other operations can take place while they are running. We refer to them as "Asynchronous" because of this trait. They have the ability to replace the entire screen, or just update a small section of the page. This enables the construction of more fluid, "desktop-application-like" user experiences. For example, Trello https://trello.com/ (an online organizational tool), allows the creation and re-ordering of cards without any full page refreshes. Asynchronous requests are everywhere in modern web applications.

You will often hear this style of JavaScript-driven Asynchronous requests referred to as AJAX.

## Instructions
In today's assignment, you will write code exclusively for the client-side (browser). We have gone ahead and built a server for you to interact with. In the following few days, you will retake control over both the client and server-side code.

You should fork, then clone this repository at:
- `http://github.com/bitmakerlabs/first-ajax`
Open up this file (README.md) in your editor, so that when it asks you a question, you can __answer__ it below. However, because this file is in Markdown format, it __reads__ best when viewed on GitHub.

The server you will be interacting with is deployed at:
- `http://first-ajax-api.herokuapp.com/`

The URLs within the server (AKA 'endpoints', AKA 'resources') we're going to work with are:
- `/` <- the root path
- `/ping`
- `/pong`
- `/count`
- `/time`
- `/a_car`

Each time you use one of these paths, you will have to use the fully-qualified URL. For example: `http://first-ajax-api.herokuapp.com/count`

## Step 0 - Setup and Knowledge Check
- Consider disabling your browser extensions, as they might make unexpected and confusing HTTP requests. For Chrome users, the easiest way to do this is opening a "New Incognito Window" from the File menu and running your requests there.
- Open your browser's "Developer Tools/Inspector". Navigate to the "Network" tab. This must be kept open for the duration of the assignment.

### Knowledge Check
In your browser's address bar, type the "root path" of the server we have setup at http://first-ajax-api.herokuapp.com/, and hit enter. You can deeply inspect each request by clicking on it. You can return to the summary view by clicking the (x) to the left of the Headers tab. Use these tools to answer the following question:

1. What HTTP method did your browser use to make the request?
GET method
2. How many milliseconds did it take your browser to complete it?
Each time there was different time.
3. What HTTP status code did the server return? What does that mean?
- 200 OK
- 304
- 500
4. Look at the "Initiator" and "Type" columns. Was this an xhr/JavaScript/AJAX request or a normal browser request?
Document- a normal browser request

## Step 1 - Your First AJAX Request
We're going to use jQuery to make our AJAX requests. A flexible, and powerful way to do this is using the `ajax` function inside jQuery. To invoke the `ajax` function, you call it on the `$` object, and pass in a JavaScript object as an argument. Every time we make an AJAX request, that object will have __4__ main attributes.

1. The __url__ ( e.g. 'http://fun.com/pets', '/pets', or 'pets' )
  - _Which server-side resource(s) is the request interacting with?_
2. The __method__ ( e.g. 'GET', 'POST', 'PATCH', 'PUT', or 'DELETE' )
  - _What is the request trying to do?_
3. The __data__ ( A JavaScript object e.g. { }, {water: 'wet'}, or {clowns: 6, fun_level: 'poor'} )
  - _What information should the request send TO the server?_
4. The __dataType__ ( e.g. 'text', 'html', 'json', or 'xml' )
  - _What type of data does the browser expect in response?_

Here is a basic skeleton for an AJAX call. It is missing values for its 4 attributes, but it makes a good template for the practice sections:
```javascript
$.ajax({
  url: _____,
  method: _____,
  data: _____,
  dataType: _____
});
```

### Practice
1. Open the index.html file in your browser.
2. In the linked ajax.js file, build an AJAX request that:
  - _retrieves the information at the root path of the server, by sending an empty JavaScript object, and expecting a text response._
3. Ensure the request is wrapped in a `$(document).ready`.
4. Ensure your Network Tab is open in Developer tools, and run the request by reloading your page.
5. What are the values in the "Method" and "Status" columns? Compare these values to Step 0.
6. What are the values in the "Type" and "Initiator" columns? Compare these values to Step 0.

Congratulations! You've made your first successful AJAX request!

## Step 2 - Binding to A Click Event
It can be useful to fire off an AJAX request as soon as the page is finished loading. However, it's more common for them to run as a result of a user taking action on your page. Currently, our AJAX request runs immediately on `$(document).ready`. We triggered it by refreshing the page. Let's separate the two events with a "click event handler" similar to the others you practiced this week.

### Practice
1. In your index.html file, add a `<button>` that says "Run AJAX Request to Root" to the Step 1 and 2 `<section>`
2. Back in ajax.js, Create a `'click'` event handler for the button, and move your AJAX call inside it.
3. Refresh your page to load the new JavaScript.
4. Try clicking your button a few times! In your network tab, inspect the requests as they come in.

Now we are in control of when the request is made.

## Step 3 - Using Information in the Response
The root path of our server indicated "success", but didn't send any content back. Usually, a successful response will return some data to the browser... How do we take action in this success scenario? How do we make use of the data the server sends back?

jQuery's lets us "chain" a call to the function `done` on the end of our call to `$.ajax`. As an argument to the `done` function, we can pass in another brand-new function. It will be called if-and-when the AJAX request succeeds. You already know how to pass functions that will be called when an event occurs, so this may sound familiar. This concept of "callback functions" extends to AJAX, and it looks like this:

```javascript
$.ajax({
  url: ,
  method: ,
  data: ,
  dataType:
}).done(function (responseData) {
  //Here in the callback, we have a variable called responseData
  //that holds the content of the server's response,
  //in this case, a simple string
});
```

Let's switch to a URL that returns data in its response, and write a function to do something with it.

### Practice
1. Add a new `<button>` that says "Run AJAX Request to Ping/Pong" to the Step 3,4,5,6 `<section>`
2. Create a new AJAX request bound to the `<button>` that retrieves the information at the `/ping` url (Send no data, expect text as a response).
3. Open your Network tab, reload the page, and run your request.
4. Click on the request. This displays a detailed view of this one request. Investigate the "Response" and "Preview" sub-tabs. What was the content of the response?
5. In a `done` callback, use console.log to write the responseData string to the console.
6. Also in the `done` callback use jQuery to append the responseData string to the `<section>` element.

## Step 4 - When Things Go Wrong...
Just like any HTTP request, AJAX requests don't always work out. You might have the `url` wrong, be sending the wrong `data`, or perhaps your user just entered a subway tunnel and the internet cuts out. Sometimes, it is important to anticipate this situation and handle the outcome in a graceful way.

Just like with `done`, we can pass a callback function to `fail`. It will be called if-and-when the request fails.

```javascript
$.ajax({
  url: ,
  method: ,
  data: ,
  dataType:
}).fail(function () {
  //In this callback, everyone panic! Our request has failed!
  //Quickly, apologize to the user and try to fix it!
});
```

### Practice
1. Modify your AJAX request so that it points to the `/pong` url. Note that it's now p-o-n-g not p-i-n-g. This will simulate a server error.
2. Open your Network tab, reload the page, and run your request.
3. What is the new HTTP status code?
4. Add a `fail` callback, and use jQuery to append a nice message to the `<section>` telling the user that you'll try harder next time.

## Step 5 - Tidy Up Time...
Sometimes, there's code that needs to be run whether the request was a total success or a complete failure. You don't care about the outcome, but the request-response cycle has finished and there's cleanup work to do.

Maybe you want to re-enable the submit button on a form, hide a spinning "loading" indicator, or tidy up some local data. It wouldn't be very D.R.Y. to duplicate this code in both the `done` and `fail` callbacks, so there's one final thing you can chain onto `$.ajax` ... the `always` function.

```javascript
$.ajax({
  url: ,
  method: ,
  data: ,
  dataType:
}).always(function () {
  //Well, I'm not really sure how that went, and I don't care
  //All I know is, it's over.
});
```
### Practice
1. Add an `always` callback, and use console.log to output a message like "Hey the request finished!"

## Step 6 - All Together Now!
So `$.ajax` requests will usually have a `done` callback, and they can add `fail` and `always` when appropriate. You should now have an AJAX request with a structure similar to this:

```javascript
$.ajax({
  url: ,
  method: ,
  data: ,
  dataType:
}).done(function (responseData) {
  //Yay we did it!
}).fail(function () {
  //That did NOT go well.
}).always(function () {
  //All I know is, it's over.
});
```

### Practice
1. Ensure that each of the `done`, `fail`, and `always` callbacks at least applies a meaningful console.log message.
2. Switch back and forth between the `/ping` and `/pong` URLs, reloading the page and running your request each time. What do you see in your Developer Tools? What messages show up in your console?

## Step 7 - The Hive Mind (Shared State)
You and your fellow classmates have been interacting with the same server, hosted on the internet, as a Heroku app. That's what makes today's assignment different from a standalone in-browser app or game. The State (AKA memory, data, information) is stored on the _server_, not just locally on your browser. Jazzy Front-End Applications can speak to a server with a database, just like our Non-AJAX Rails apps from weeks 3 and 4.

To prove to you that you are all connected, we're going to change URL's once again.

### Practice
1. Add a new `<button>` that says "Run AJAX Request to Count" to the Step 7 `<section>`
2. Create a new AJAX request bound to the `<button>` that retrieves the information at the `/count` url (Send no data, expect text as a response).
3. Run your request and investigate your Network tab. This is a shared count of the total number of Bitmakers to ever visit this URL.
4. In a `done` callback, write the responseData to the Step 7 `<section>`. Ask your neighbour what number they got and compare. Run your request a few times and compare again!

## Step 8 - Sending Data with your Request
It's time for our AJAX request to send information TO the server, in addition to getting responseData FROM the server. We do this by supplying a JavaScript object as `data` in our call to `$.ajax`. It is a set of key-value pairs and looks like this:

```javascript
$.ajax({
  url: ,
  method: ,
  data: {food: 'pancakes', quantity: 6, type: 'blueberry'},
  dataType:
})
```

These "request parameters" will be sent to our server, and may affect the response we get back. The contents of the `data` object can vary. Sometimes the values are hard-coded, while other times they are from a user typing in a form. Any piece of information we want to accompany our request should be encoded in this data object.

### Practice
1. Add a new `<button>` that says "Run AJAX Request to Time" to the Step 8 `<section>`
2. Create a new AJAX request bound to the `<button>` that retrieves the information at the `/time` url (Send no data, expect text as a response).
3. Add a `done` callback and write the responseData to the Step 8 `<section>`.
4. Run the request, and see the current server time get written to the page.
5. Modify the request to send a `timezone` as a piece of data, for example: 'Europe/Sofia'.
6. Try changing 'Europe/Sofia' to a different time zone and see what the time is in that part of the world! Some other valid timezones are: 'America/Mexico_City', or 'Pacific/Honolulu', or 'Asia/Kolkata'

## Step 9 - Receiving HTML in the Response
Until now, every response we've received from the server was a 'text' type response. That is, just a string for us to console.log or write to our document. It's common for AJAX responses to contain more complex types, such as 'html'. Let's switch to a URL that will give us an 'html' type response. We call these small chunks of HTML markup "fragments", because they are often missing the `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.

### Practice
1. Add a new `<button>` that says "Run AJAX Request to A Car " to the Step 9 `<section>`
2. Build a new AJAX request bound to the `<button>` that retrieves the info at the `/a_car` URL. Send no `data`, but __this time expect 'html' in response__. Refresh the page, click the `<button>`, and inspect the response.
3. Investigate the Request and Response "Headers" in your Network Tab. What is the 'Accepts' of the Request, and the 'Content-Type' of the response?
4. Add an empty unordered list `<ul>` to the section. Give it an id attribute.
5. Add a `done` callback that writes the responseData to the unordered list inside the section.
6. Refresh your page, and try the button a few times!

That's it, you're done! This is a very common way for modern web apps to work. First, load an HTML document with some linked up JavaScript in an initial (non-AJAX) request. Second, bind AJAX requests as event handlers in a `$(document).ready`. Third, run those AJAX requests when a user takes action (i.e. `click`). Fourth, receive a complex `dataType` (html or other) and use the `responseData` to modify the HTML document.

Commit your code and this README.md file with your answers in it. Then push!

## Stretch
1. Return to the `/pong` request. There's a hidden message there... can you find it? Can you find a way to capture this text and write it to the `<body>`? Hint: Since this request fails, you'll need to modify the method signature of your `.fail` callback to be `function( jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown )`. Try putting a breakpoint inside your fail callback... Use it to inspect those newly captured variables...
2. Return to the `/count` request. This URL actually accepts a data parameter called `amount`. What are the acceptable values for it? What does it do?
3. Return to the `/time` request. Bind this request to a new `<button>`'s click event. Change from a hardcoded `timezone` parameter to accepting input from the user via a textbox. Add a `fail` callback that writes an error message to the `<section>`. Test it by entering an invalid `timezone` such as 'pokeroo'?
